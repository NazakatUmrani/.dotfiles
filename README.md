❄️ NixOS dotfiles ❄️

<p align="left">
On my main machine I use NixOS as my daily driver Operating System, NixOS is reproducible, immutable, declarative and more.
I love to explore to world of Linux, and with nixos not only I can declare all my settings in files, I can recreate my entire system with just those files again, in other OS, when we install, we need to do every configuration by ourselves, and in case of breaking and bugs, if we reinstall the system, all settings, extensions, themes, are wiped and we need to start from the scratch again, but with nixos now I got everything declared in my files, just need to run this command below and everything is configured back as how it was before the breaking.

```
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#
